Word-bothering made easy: quick text explorations with python

* Do it the way you can remember how to do it, not the nicest possible way
* Try stuff with list and string manipulation before getting fancy
* Put your English dictionaries in Python dictionaries for much faster searches
* If something gets complicated, save it for another day. Algorithm works on words but not sentences? Let's play with words today.
* If something isn't quite right, is it worth the trouble to fix it? My cmudict lookup only gets the first pronunciation of each word. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` Good enough. My list of fishes stolen from wikipedia includes some things that aren't fishes. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯ >< o>`
* Not every exploration comes up with anything interesting.
